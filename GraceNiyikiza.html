		My passion is to become software developer even if it is so difficult for me,I will work hard for making it.
		<br>
		I really want to develop software as an app which will help people who had mental illness to be treated.
		<br>
		One day I will make it because during this time we have many suicide cases and i think this app will help a lot of people to be treated and getting advices from psychologists and this suicide cases can be reduced.
		<br>
		I realized our digital world is addicted to social media but knew how their mental healthy is.
